# synthetic-TIS-prediction-model
The continuation of a bahcelor's project that can be found in the [TIS-synthetic-data repository](https://github.com/YunseolPark/BAthesis-TIS-prediction-using-synthetic-data).
This project is on the generation of a translation initiation site (TIS) prediction model and the analysis of said model through the use of synthetic datasets and transfer learning.

The deep learning model is generated with PyTorch.
Synthetic datasets are used with occlusion of different features to obtain interpretability of the model.
